# Introduction
This is mix of do's and don's when talking with developers, this is not finite list there are many more I pick those which are especially important when talking to devs. You will notice that all of them also apply to all people even wife and kids:-)  
If you have anything to share, any experience thoughts feel free to do so.


## Basic people skills
- Don't criticize, condemn or complain
We are starting big. This is hobby in Poland. 
This is extremely easy to complain, and wining will not change anything
Biggest insult,
People become defensive, provide info about code review about two stubborn devs
If you criticize others ideas they will defend it
what to do instead?
ask questions, focus on common goal, I like one thing and if you would improve 3rd slide it would be awesome

- Take others perspective
Lukasz Szyd≈Ço - none of developers come to work with thought "I will fuck up some code today"
Understand others limitation, constraints, reasons
Ask many questions to understand!
If you disagree focus on goal and discuss how to achieve it
Focus on what you have in common not what is dividing
Makes easier for both of you to work on

- Give honest and sincere appreciation
This is extremely hard because we are used to complain which is much easier
Calling mother in law, and talking about who is is sick who died etc
Freud: People are doing everything for sex or to be great
Appreciate, but this should not be simple and without honesty 
People recognize false recognition
Promote behaviors not people
Github starts,  people love appreciation.

## How to make people like you
- Smile
Put photo here
As simple as that, it is free 
It is attitude, try to be positive

- Encourage others to talk, be a listener
show your sincere interests in what they are doing
Those who listen learn more

- Never say 'You are wrong'
This is invite to argument and puts person in defensive position
As mentioned before in code review example, people will be defending their decisions.
Even if you have person who does not like argue, he will accept everything you say, he may eventually explode or quit.

- Ask questions instead of giving orders
Those questions should, lead person to solution.
How would you handle situation A in your solution?
Are you covering situation B?
It requires preparation for discussion.
Situation with cson,xml,json

- Praise every improvement
This will mean you are paying attention.
You care about people. There is no bigger reward that someone notices what you achieved.
Be specific! 

- Trust your people
if you show them goal they will be able to get there.
The most fun project I was working in was with architect.... story about Tieto
We felt that what we are building really matters and we were able to be creative 
He was still to help us, and he saw bigger picture, had control over that

- People will do things when they want to
You can force people to do things, especially if you are their boss
If they are engaged
