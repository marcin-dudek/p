## Basic people skills
- Don't criticize, condemn or complain
This is extremly easy
Biggest insult,
People become defensive, provide info about code review about two sutbborn devs
If you criticize others ideas they will defend it

- Give honest and sincere appreciation
This is extremly hard because we are used to complain which is much easier
Calling motrher in law, and talking about who is is sick who died etc
Freud: People are doing everything for sex or to be great
Appreciate, but this should not be simple and without honesty
People recognize false recognition
Promote behaviours not people
Github starts,  people lobve appreciation.

- Take others perspective
Lukasz Szyd≈Ço - none of developers come to work with thougth "Iw ill fuck up some code today"
Understand others limitaytion, constraints, resonal
Ask many questions to understand!
If you disagree focus on goal and discuss how to achieve it
FOcus on what you have in common not what is dividing
Makes easier for both of you to work on

## How to make people like you
- Smile
Put photo here
As simple as that, it is free 
It is attitude

- Encourage others to talk about themselves
show your sincere interests in what they are doing

- Remember persons name
One persons name is more important than whole names altogether
